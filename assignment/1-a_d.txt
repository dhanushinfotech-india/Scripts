a) 
See the following Python program which contains 3 errors. Errors 
include statements that might be missing. 
       import sys 
       # Reads lines of standard input, adds each line to a list, 
       # prints the list. 
       for line in sys.stdin 
       myList.append( line ) 
       print myList 
Correct the 3 errors in this program, and write the corrected version in the 
space below:

Answer:

import sys

myList = [] # First Error: Initialize the list 

for line in sys.stdin: # Second Error: End with colon
    myList.append(line) # Third Error: Provide indentation

print myList
